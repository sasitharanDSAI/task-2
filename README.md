Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

Superstore Dashboard Report
I've built a Power BI dashboard to analyze sales and profit performance from the Superstore dataset. Ir report includes:
KPI Tiles:


Total Profit: $286.40K


Total Sales: $2.30M


Total Orders: 5,009


Sales & Profit Trends Over Time (Monthly):


A line graph showing monthly trends of Sales and Profit.


Shows seasonality and key spikes throughout the year.


Sales by Sub-Category:


A bar chart displaying which sub-categories (e.g., Phones, Chairs, Binders) are driving sales.


Profit by Sub-Category:


Identifies the most and least profitable sub-categories.


Copiers and Phones lead in profit, while Tables and Bookcases show low or negative profit.


Profit by State:


A map or bar chart showing state-wise profit distribution.


California, New York, and Washington lead in profitability.



Filter Panel (Slicers):


Filters by Region, Segment, and Category to allow interactive exploration.



ðŸ“Š Report of Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Key Insights:
Top Performing Sub-Categories (Profit):


Copiers, Phones, and Accessories generate the highest profits.


Tables and Bookcases have poor profitability and may require review for cost efficiency or pricing.


Top Sales Sub-Categories:


Phones, Chairs, and Storage contribute most to total sales.


Monthly Trends:


Significant sales and profit spikes in November and December, suggesting seasonal shopping effects (likely due to holiday promotions).


Low sales and profit in earlier months like February and March.


State-wise Profit:


California dominates in terms of both sales and profit.


States like Texas or Pennsylvania (not shown prominently) might be underperforming.


Customer Segments:


Iâ€™ve enabled analysis by Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments to explore which group contributes the most to revenue and profitability.




ðŸ›  Suggestions for Improvement:
Add a profit margin percentage visual for better comparison across sub-categories.


Include a loss analysis: highlight where the company is losing money (especially relevant for Tables, Bookcases).


Implement a year-over-year comparison if historical data is available.


Consider adding forecasting or trend lines for sales and profit over time.
