Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

What I Have Done
Built a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard for Superstore sales and profit analysis.

Imported and cleaned data from the Sample Superstore dataset (CSV format).

Used bar charts, line charts, and KPI cards to visualize:

Monthly sales and profit trends

Sales and profit by sub-category

Profit by state

Added slicers for Region, Segment, and Category to enable user-driven filtering.

Calculated key performance metrics such as:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Total Orders
